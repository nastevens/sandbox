To make sources for GumStix, simply issue the "make" command in the root
program directory.  This will built both the GumStix communication daemon
(gscomd) and the GumStix communication test program (gscomtest).  Both 
binaries will be stripped of debugging information.  To built without 
stripping, run "make debug"

Issuing "make gscomtest" or "make gscomd" will make only the indicated
binary, and will not strip debugging information from the binaries.
